# SPPIN 2023 Challenge
This folder contains code relevant to the SPPIN 2023 challenge.

The Jupyter Notebooks contain code that was used to either explore or preprocess the data.

`sppin_config.json` contains the configuration file for training the model.

`Dockerfile_sppin` and `process.py` can be used to create 
a Docker container that can be submitted as an algorithm on the 
grandchallenge website.
The Dockerfile must be moved to the main 3DUnetCNN directory before building the docker image.
